# See Tickets Code Challenge

This is my solution for the See Tickets code challenge

# Requirements
* Visual Studio 2019

# Instructions
* Run the application from VS.
* That's it, amazingly enough.
* View the output in the window, or in "{project_directory}/Presentation/bin/debug/netcoreapp3.0/output.json".

# Notes
* A unit test project is present, however no part of the system allows for user input, so it's little more than a placeholder for now.

# Acknowledgements
* HTMLAgilityPack guidance: https://vainolo.com/2020/05/06/scraping-web-pages-with-c-and-htmlagilitypack/
